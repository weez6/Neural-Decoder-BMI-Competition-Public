# A neural decoder for continuous position estimation

An offline decoder for predicting arm trajectories in 8 directions from monkey neural spike trains in a centre-out task ("monkeytraining_data.mat"). This model employs supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including PCA, nearest centroid classification, and principle component regression for dimensionality reduction, classification, and regression respectively. 

To test, run testFunction_for_students_MTb which uses positionEstimator, positionEstimatorTraining, and the data.
