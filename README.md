# A neural decoder for continuous position estimation

An offline decoder for predicting arm trajectories in 8 directions from monkey neural spike trains in a centre-out task ("monkeytraining_data.mat"). This model employs supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including PCA, nearest centroid classification, and principle component regression for dimensionality reduction, classificaiton, and regression respectively. 

Submitted for the 2023 Imperial Bioengineering Brain Machine Interfaces course competition and won 1st place (based on RMSE accuracy and run-time).
